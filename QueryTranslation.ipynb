Additionally, such cybersecurity incidents could adversely affect Amazon's operating results, lead to litigation, liability, regulatory actions, deter customers or sellers from using their services, and harm their business reputation. Amazon uses third-party technology and systems for various functions, including encryption and authentication, which could introduce additional risks if not properly secured. The company conducts application security assessments, vulnerability management, penetration testing, security audits, and ongoing risk assessments to mitigate these cybersecurity risks. Amazon also maintains incident response plans, provides cybersecurity training to employees, and has a dedicated team led by a chief security officer overseeing cybersecurity and data protection practices.
